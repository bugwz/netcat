* Netcat 0.6.1 - 15 Sep 2002 - Release Notes

A bugfix release for the 0.6 major version.  This version may be
the last one for a long period, but it should be enough stable
to stick to.
Most important fix is indeed the Solaris related code added, that
makes it able to use Netcat's UDP features on this OS too.  Other
fixes are in compilation scripts and internal socket code.  It
should also be a bit faster.  Always report bugs to the Netcat
bug tracking system on SourceForge.



* Netcat 0.6.0 - 22 Aug 2002 - Release Notes

The summer brought advice and this is the new major release of
Netcat.  In this version many important improvements and fixes
are introduced, like the new UDP protocol routines and the ability
to cross-protocol bridge between TCP and UDP in tunnel mode, and
the new signal handling functions that allow sockets to be cleanly
closed and shutdown before Netcat terminates.
Also some portability problems were fixed but there is still
something to do to achieve a good cross-platform support.
This version introduces much new development code and thus may
contain bugs.  Please test a lot and always report bugs through
the Netcat bug tracking system.



* Netcat 0.5.2 - 18 Jun 2002 - Release Notes

This is another bugfix release that includes a lot of very important
bugfixes like a better handling of unexpected situations and
improved error messages and verbose info messages. A first version
of the documentation (man page and info page) is now fully complete.
All Netcat users are encouraged to download and try this new version
and to report bugs.



* Netcat 0.5.1 - 10 Jun 2002 - Release Notes

And here it is the bugfix release.  This version of Netcat should
be much more stable than the previous one.
Most important fixes are the UDP listen mode which caused one
packet to be lost, and a internal problem causing a "socket
already in use" error which shouldn't happen.
There are also many fixes for the portability.  Netcat now
compiles correctly under Solaris and some other OSes.



* Netcat 0.5.0 - 31 May 2002 - Release Notes

This version introduces a new internal socket interface which
allows a better new features support.  The UDP protocol and
the tunnel mode are also greatly improved from the previous
versions.
Note that there have been an important command line interface
change about the tcp/telnet switches.  The new telnet switch
is now `-T', while the tcp protocol selection took the old
`-t' switch.  The configure option --enable-compat restores
the old interface.
Fixed also many minor bugs.



* Netcat 0.4.0 - 15 May 2002 - Release Notes

The first beta version of GNU Netcat!
This should be self-explanatory, but I will write some
basic notes anyway.
Main netcat functions, like the UDP support, the telnet protocol
support, and the zero-I/O mode (used for scanning) are now
restored, and many bugs have been fixed, improving notably
the stability.
Another important addition is the configure command option
`--enable-compat', which turnes on ALL the backwards
compatibility support available in the GNU Netcat.
Refer to ChangeLog for a full list of changes.



* Netcat 0.3.1 - 9 May 2002 - Release Notes

This is the usual bugfix release following a major release.
In this release many smaller things are improved and fixed,
which makes it a stabler version good for testing and bug
reporting.
New features will be added for the next major release, so
if you have any suggestion or feature request this is the
right time to submit them.



* Netcat 0.3.0 - 6 May 2002 - Release Notes

Here it is, finally the first fully rewritten release is out!
In this release there is the new core part of the program that
allows me to start the real work.  From now on I will be able
to implement many more new features.
Please remember that this release is still "alpha" and there
are many known bugs, but feel free to report any bug or broken
feature that you may experience testing the package.



* Netcat 0.2.2 - 1 May 2002 - Release Notes

This is a bugfix release that introduces the contrib library,
containing all the library functions that should be supported
by the System.
This version also updates translation files and improves input
validity checks for port numbers.



* Netcat 0.2.1 - 30 Apr 2002 - Release Notes

Surely the most important change in this release is the Native
Language Support addition.

Another important addition is the configure option
`--enable-oldhexdump', which remarks one of the most important
points of this project, the full compatibility with the
original nc110.
