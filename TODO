The GNU Netcat project.

    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==============================

 o Write the README file!

 o I need to study deeply the -g/-G options issue in order to make
   nc more stable

 o make install should also symlink nc -> netcat

 o Add command line switch -X, --input-hexdump so that read from
   stdin some valid hexdump-style data, and accepts it in some
   standard forms (more than one)

 o Add doc/migrating (or something else) describing everything you
   always wanted to know for changing from nc to GNU netcat.

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool,
   so I can give credits to the right people for the design and
   the original code.
