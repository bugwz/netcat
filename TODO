This file contains all the broken/planned things to do within
The GNU Netcat project.

If you wish to contribute about one of these points, feel free
to mail me if you need any further information.



    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==================================

 o Write the README file!

 o I need to study deeply the -g/-G options issue in order to make
   it working properly.

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool,
   so I can give credits to the right people for the design and
   the original code.

 o The configure script must properly check res_init() by including
   the <resolv.h> file.

 o Make it compiling on SunOS. It requires -lsocket -lnsl -lresolv.

 o Netcat should be ported on Win32 too, but I haven't Win32 coding
   experience unfortunately.  Anyone is willing to help?

 o I think that two netcats with the `-T' (telnet) option enabled
   may enter an infinite loop because of the weak telnet protocol
   implementation. Check this and fix.

 o The current UDP connection system refers on a weak extension
   of the RFC 2292, which very few OS support (read: only linux).
   If this option is unavailable (from the configure script) the
   UDP connection is broken. I need a work-around like binding to
   all the interfaces (see: ISC BIND9)



    Future features/Planning
==================================

 o Add IPv6 support

    o This should be controlled by a command line switch like
      `-6' and `-4'.

    o Netcat should also be able to tunnel ipv6/ipv4 in tunnel
      mode

 o Add command line switch -X, --input-hexdump so that read from
   stdin some valid hexdump-style data, and accepts it in some
   standard forms (more than one)
