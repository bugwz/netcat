@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly
or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is
a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the original program was named,
should have been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but
standard Unix tools.

@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Netcat has three main modes of functionality.  These are the connect mode,
the listen mode, and the tunnel mode.

The most common mode is the connect mode, which for example allows the output
of a locally called command to be redirected for example to a remote Netcat
listening or to any other kind of daemon waiting for a connection.

On the other hand, the listen mode can be used to obtain some kind of stream
of data from a remote site.

The most new feature is the tunnel mode, which is a powerful and reliable
mode that allows tunneling a remote site towards any other remote site,
allowing to specify for example from which interface create the connection
and from which port.

Use the TCP protocol. this is the default.  It may be useful (see Tunnel Mode)
to specify this option after for example the UDP option in order to allow a
cross-tunneling between TCP and UDP.

@item -u
@itemx --udp
Use the UDP protocol. see TCP.

@table @samp
@item -i SECS
@itemx --interval SECS
sets the buffering output delay time. This affects all the current modes and
makes the connection sock to buffer outgoing data. this means that in tunnel
mode everything received from the listening socket is buffered for the connect
socket.

@item -r
@itemx --randomize
randomizes the target remote ports ranges.  If more than one range is
specified it will randomize the ports in the whole range.
