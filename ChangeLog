[*] Tue Apr 30 2002 - netcat v0.2.1

  o Various fixes to the Makefiles for the clean targets
  o Fixed --enable-debug configure parameter
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldhexdump', causes netcat to use the
    old hexdump style rather than my new style.
  o Added macros debug_d and debug_dv, respectively debug plus delay and
    debug verbose plus delay.  Removed the old Debug macro.
  o Restored command line switch `-w' (wait).
  o Rewrote (again) netcat_resolvehost(), this time it's a little more
    abstracted.
  o Removed libtool support (it wasn't really needed at the moment)
  o Added Native Language Support to the project
  o Added the first traslation file (italian)


[*] Mon Apr 29 2002 - netcat v0.2.0

  o Changed the define HINF to typedef netcat_host.
  o Removed comparehosts() function.
  o Removed gethostpoop() function.
  o Fixed some warnings.
  o Added file network.c, containing function netcat_resolvehost(), which is
    the equivalent of the old gethostpoop().
  o Added debug() and debug_v() routines, to improve debugging output.
    Debug() is now obsolete and will be removed soon.
  o Added file proto.h, containing all externs and function declarations.
  o Changed some global variable names and types
  o Added function netcat_fhexdump() which substitutes the old oprint()
    function.  Removed some unused global variables.
  o Added command line switch `-x' (hexdump). Switch `-o' implies `-x'.
  o Added command line switch `-V' (version).
  o Added function netcat_getport() which substitutes the old getportpoop().
    Updated references to the function and related struct.


[*] Sun Apr 28 2002 - netcat v0.1.0

  o Great cleanup of the original source files, this will be the base for the
    rewrite.
  o Rewrote command line reader from stdin (dynamically rebuilds argv based on
    the input string.
  o Added functions netcat_string_split() and netcat_commandline().
